# Stock_Price_Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting stock prices** using advanced **time series forecasting techniques**. It leverages historical stock market data and applies models such as **SARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet** to accurately forecast future stock trends. 

The project demonstrates the complete **data analysis workflow**, including **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization**. Additionally, a **Streamlit dashboard** is provided for interactive visualization of predictions versus actual stock prices.
